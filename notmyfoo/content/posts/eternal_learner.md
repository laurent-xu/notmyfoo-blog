Hello this is my first post.

I am a C++ developer working in trading. You will hear more about me if I don't get lazy about writing.

**Topics I like that I have been exploring for a while now:**
- Low latency programming for trading
- C++
- Data structures and Algorithms
- Career evolution as a Software Engineer

**New topics I am trying to learn more about:**
- Low latency programming part 2.
  - Unix programming
  - x86
  - Networking
  - Hardware engineering (FPGA, Verilog, VHDL)
- Finance engineering
  - Probality and statistics
  - Machine learning
  - Stochastics calculus
- Web development
- Devops
- Distributed systems
- Board game making

I am not very good at making baby steps everyday. I hope this blog will keep me moving more things from the second list to the first list.
